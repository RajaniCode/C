///    body, read the response headers, and read the response body. This class provides an IAsyncResult interface that
///    can be used to wait until all these operations are complete, atomically. The CompletedSynchronously property will
///    be set to true only if all operations completed synchronously. During this process we do not hold up any threads.
///    
/// 2. If an error occurs along the way, the exception is stored in the Error property. In such a case WebResponse and
///    ResponseBody may or may not be null. In either case, it is guaranteed that the AsyncWaitHandle event will be set
///    and your callback called (in that order).
