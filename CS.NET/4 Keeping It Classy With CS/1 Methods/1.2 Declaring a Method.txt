1.2 Declaring a Method

Let's create a new method at the bottom of the Program class that takes the name of a venue as a string argument and returns a formatted announcement.

Program.cs
using System;

public class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("What is the name of your venue?");

        string venue = args[0]; // Sets the venue based on the command-line argument. We'll cover arrays in Level 3!

    }

}

1. Below the Main method, create a new static string method called Announce. This method should accept a single string parameter named venue.

Inside the method, return the provided venue parameter concatenated with " will have bands performing tonight." appended to the end.

Answer
Program.cs
using System;

public class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("What is the name of your venue?");

        string venue = args[0]; // Sets the venue based on the command-line argument. We'll cover arrays in Level 3!

    }
    
    static string Announce(string venue)
    {
        return venue + " will have bands performing tonight.";
    }
}

2. At the end of the Main method, create another call to Console.WriteLine. The argument for this should be the string returned by calling Announce with the variable venue as its argument.

Answer
Program.cs
using System;

public class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("What is the name of your venue?");

        string venue = args[0]; // Sets the venue based on the command-line argument. We'll cover arrays in Level 3!

        Console.WriteLine(Announce(venue);
    }

    static string Announce(string venue)
    {
        return venue + " will have bands performing tonight.";
    }

}
