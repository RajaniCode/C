2.3 Access Modifiers

Let's make our Venue class and its contents accessible to other classes.

Venue.cs
using System;

class Venue
{
    string Name;

    void Announce()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Name + " will have several bands playing tonight!");
    }
}

Change the access modifier for the Venue class, the Name variable, and the Announce method to make them available to other classes.

Answer
Venue.cs
using System;

public class Venue
{
    public string Name;

    public void Announce()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Name + " will have several bands playing tonight!");
    }
}
