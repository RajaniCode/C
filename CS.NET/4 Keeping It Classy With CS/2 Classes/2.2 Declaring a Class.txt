2.2 Declaring a Class

Let's create a new Venue class that will contain a Name variable and an Announce method that will write our venue announcement message to the console.

Venue.cs
using System;

1. Declare a class named Venue.

Answer
Venue.cs
using System;

class Venue { }

2. Inside the Venue class, add an instance variable of data type string called Name.

Answer
Venue.cs
using System;

class Venue
{
    string Name;
}

3. Create a method named Announce() that won't return any data and doesn't accept any parameters. This method should use Console.WriteLine to print the Name of the venue followed by " will have several bands playing tonight!".

Answer
Venue.cs
using System;

class Venue
{
    string Name;

    void Announce()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Name + " will have several bands playing tonight!");
    }
}
