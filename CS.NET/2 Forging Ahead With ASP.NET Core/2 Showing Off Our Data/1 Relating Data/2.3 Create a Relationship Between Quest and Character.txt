2.3 Create a Relationship Between Quest and Character

We need to set up the relationship between our Character and Quest objects. Let's set up the relationship through our Quest object.

Models/Character.cs

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

namespace ForgingAhead.Models
{
  public class Character
  {
    [Key]
    [Required]
    [MinLength(3, ErrorMessage="Your character name must be at least 3 characters long.")]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [Display(Name = "Is Active")]
    public bool IsActive { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [Range(1, 20, ErrorMessage = "Your level must be between 1 and 20.")]
    public int Level { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [Range(1, 18, ErrorMessage = "Your base strength must be between 1 and 18.")]
    public int Strength { get; set; }

    [Required(ErrorMessage = "The Dexterity field is required.")]
    [Range(1, 18, ErrorMessage = "Your base dexterity must be between 1 and 18.")]
    public int Dexterity { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [Range(1, 18, ErrorMessage = "Your base intelligence must be between 1 and 18.")]
    public int Intelligence { get; set; }

    public List<Equipment> Equipment { get; set; } = new List<Equipment>();
  }
}

Models/Quest.cs

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

namespace ForgingAhead.Models
{
  public class Quest
  {
    [Key]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public bool IsActive { get; set; }

    // set up relationship here
    
  }
}


To set up our relationship we'll need to create a property that is a List of Character objects. We'll name this list Characters.

Answer:

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

namespace ForgingAhead.Models
{
  public class Quest
  {
    [Key]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public bool IsActive { get; set; }

    // set up relationship here
    public List<Character> Characters { get; set; }
  }
}
