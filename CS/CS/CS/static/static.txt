// In case static variable is used either in instance method or static method, 
// and assigned value from OUTSIDE the method USING CONSTRUCTOR CALL in Main() in the same or different class
// UNLIKE THE CASE OF INSTANCE VARIABLE, the CONSTRUCTOR CALL should be USED ONCE, 
// otherwise ONLY THE LAST ASSIGNED VALUE will be the value FOR ALL CONSTRUCTOR CALL USAGE
 
// [ALSO IN CASE OF assignments USING CLASS, the CLASS should be USED ONCE in Main() in the same or different class
//  otherwise ONLY THE LAST ASSIGNED VALUE will be the value FOR ALL CLASS USAGE] 
// [BUT NOT IN CASE OF assignments USING METHOD CALLS in Main() in the same or different class]
