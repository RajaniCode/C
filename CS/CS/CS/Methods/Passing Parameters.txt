Pass by value VS Pass by reference:

When you pass by value, a copy of the variable is passed and not the actual variable.

However, when you pass by reference, the memory address of the variable is passed. Thus, the called method can modify the value of the underlying variable.




Pass by reference VS Pass by out:

ref cannot be passed before intializing it.

out must be assigned in the called method.




Using ref on references:

Check out 1.cs, 2.cs, and 3.cs in using ref on references




params:

A params parameter must be the last parameter in a formal parameter list
