1.
Open a Visual Studio command prompt. 

[Going to the ...SignedFriendAssembly\bin\Debug folder]

2.
Use the following sequence of commands with the Strong Name tool to generate a keyfile and to display its public key. 

a.
Generate a strong-name key for this example and store it in the file sgKeyCalculator.snk:

sn -k sgKeyCalculator.snk

[Note: -k should be in lower case]
[On running: Key pair written to sgKeyCalculator.snk]

b.
Extract the public key from sgKeyCalculator.snk and put it into publicKeyCalculators.publickey:

sn -p sgKeyCalculator.snk publicKeyCalculators.publickey

[On running: Public key written to publicKeyCalculators.publickey]

c.
Display the public key stored in the file publicKeyCalculators.publickey:

sn -tp publicKeyCalculators.publickey

[On running:

Microsoft (R) .NET Framework Strong Name Utility  Version 4.0.30319.1

Public key is
0024000004800000940000000602000000240000525341310004000001000100abb9e04800b33a

27fd438b

Public key token is 18bab1d69c990e13]

3. The source code uses the InternalsVisibleToAttribute attribute to declare CSC2010CS2 as a friend assembly.

The Strong Name tool generates a new public key every time it runs. Therefore, you must replace the public key in the following code with the public key you just generated, as shown in the following:

using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("CSC2010CS2, PublicKey=0024000004800000940000000602000000240000525341310004000001000100abb9e04800b33a7c9ee09160350f50bca67fe047171b167e5ab18b9630762da48de8f8f8bd085e8ac614b1506076810d83b2f8e8e0c83afe4dd3e8e8fceb32e8810fa6b050d65ed99e25cf6cec12f1eb032191277b6c86109712cc9273cfedcdccf3b77c31bb41a90c9f9489ccef3cb65992910de711022d8105384227fd438b")]
namespace SignedFriend
{
    class Calculator
    {
        internal int Power(int Number, int Exponent)
        {
            int Counter = 0;
            int Result = 1;
            while (Counter++ < Exponent)
            {
                Result *= Number;
            }
            return Result;
        }
    }
}

[4.Compile and sign SignedFriendAssembly by using the following command.
csc /keyfile:sgKeyCalculator.snk /r:SignedFriendAssembly.dll /out:CSC2010CS2.exe Program.cs]

4. In the Visual Studio
Right-click project SignedFriendAssembly
Click Properties
In the Properties, click Signing
Check the Sign the assembly checkbox
Choose the strong name key file from the dropdown by browsing to the strong name file sgKeyCalculator.snk in the ...SignedFriendAssembly\bin\Debug folder
Build the project

5. In the CSC2010CS2 project add reference to the SignedFriendAssembly project

6. In the CSC2010CS2 project, by using SignedFriend namespace, the internals of SignedFriendAssembly are visible to CSC2010CS2 assembly

7. However, before running the CSC2010CS2 project, add the strong name file sgKeyCalculator.snk to the project by following the steps in 4 for the CSC2010CS2 project

Note:
Both the current assembly and the friend assembly must be unsigned, or both must be signed with a strong name. If they are signed with a strong name, the argument to the InternalsVisibleToAttribute constructor must include the full public key as well as the name of the assembly.
