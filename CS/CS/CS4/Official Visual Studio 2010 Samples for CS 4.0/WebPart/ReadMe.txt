To run the sample

 - Change the Site URL property of the project to a valid SharePoint site on your development machine (i.e. http://<MachineName>)

When you run (F5) the sample a browser window will be opened to the home page of your development site.  From the Stie Actions menu choose "More Options..." and then create a Web Part Page.  After naming and creating the page, add the web part onto it.
