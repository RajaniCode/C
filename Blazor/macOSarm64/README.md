# Samples to accompany the official Microsoft Blazor documentation

Samples in this repository accompany the [official Microsoft Blazor documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/).

To obtain a local copy of the sample apps in this repository, use ***either*** of the following approaches:

* [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [clone it](https://docs.github.com/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your local system.
* Select the **Code** button. Select **Download ZIP** to save the repository locally. Extract the saved Zip archive (`.zip`) to access the sample apps.

## Snippet sample apps for article code examples

**WARNING**: Always follow an article's security guidance when implementing sample code.

Prior to the release of .NET 8, snippet sample apps for Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly provide the code examples that appear in Blazor articles. Many of the components in the snippet sample apps compile and run if copied to a local test app. However, the entire snippet sample apps aren't meant to be runnable demonstration sample apps, and not all of the components are completely functional. The purpose of the snippet sample apps prior to .NET 8's release is merely to supply code examples to documentation.

For the release of .NET 8 (and later releases), the sample apps for Blazor Web App and Blazor WebAssembly both supply snippets to articles and are fully working demonstration sample apps.

Blazor snippet sample apps

* Blazor Web App (.NET 8 or later)
* Blazor Server (.NET 7.0 or earlier)
* Blazor WebAssembly
