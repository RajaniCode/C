The ASP.NET Core developer certificate is in an invalid state. To fix this issue, run 'dotnet dev-certs https --clean' and 'dotnet dev-certs https' to remove all existing ASP.NET Core development certificates and create a new untrusted developer certificate. On macOS or Windows, use 'dotnet dev-certs https --trust' to trust the new certificate.

dotnet dev-certs https --clean

dotnet dev-certs https   

dotnet dev-certs https --trust
